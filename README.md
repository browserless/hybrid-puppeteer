# Hybrid Puppeteer

> Disclaimer: The application, and code within, are meant for educational purposes. This application and code is not production-ready, and should not be used in any production environment. Issues, security and other feature requests will mostly be ignored.

A web-based application to run automated-and-hybrid headless web workflows! You'll need a browser or something already running and accessible via a WebSocket connection as this application doesn't facilitate that. Feel free to clone and add your own logic to it.

## Quick Start

Familiarity with command line interface and `NodeJS` as well as `npm` installed.

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open the printed link in a web-browser and enjoy!
